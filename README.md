# ManualDuplexScan

This utility guides the user through `Manual Duplex Scanning`,
wich is needed with scanners that do not support Automatic 2-sided Scanning.
The target is mainly scanners, that have an ADF for automatically scanning multiple pages,
which always only scans one side of the pages in one run and the user
is required to rotate the pages manually between Odd and Even side scanning.

## Scanning Both Sides of a Document Using the ADF (with manual rotation)


## Merging the two scans that containt the Odd and Even sides of the original 2-sided document.
